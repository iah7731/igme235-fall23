    <h2>Design Goal</h2>
    
    <p>
        The goal for my site is to congregate information about Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo into one location for easy access and reading. My audience is people trying to get into the game at a higher level and those interested in the development history. I chose the Surfboard layout as a base because it has a simple and digestable layout for me to follow. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I was originally going to use the design I had created for the mobile layout in my final website, but in the end I went with a simple one column design to make sure all of the text was accomodated and the user didn't have to scroll sideways for more text. In the end, I kept the images in their original positions from the desktop layout.
